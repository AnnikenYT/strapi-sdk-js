## `user`

This object contains details about authenticated user. You can access it using `strapi`.

```js
// get
strapi.user;
// set user data
strapi.user.avatar = "";
```

## `axios`

You have access to the axios instance thanks `strapi.axios`. It allow you to set new headers or extend it:

```js
strapi.axios.defaults.headers.common["Authorization"] = `Bearer myToken`;
```

Note that we use [axios interceptors](https://axios-http.com/docs/interceptors) in order to synchronize your JWT token in header.
